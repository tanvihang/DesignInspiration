# Visual design and Aesthetic

![alt text](assets/image.png)

Design style - **modern & minimalist design**

I call this modern design it's because the usage of 3d object.
And for the minimalist part, because the pages is straigt to the point, selling the item.

Color scheme - black & white (which suits minimalist design which use gentle color / black & white), with a bit of accent color (**neon**)

Typography

Images & graphic
Lot of uses of 3d object, let user immerse with the product.

# Layout and Structure

![alt text](assets/image-1.png)

1. Header and Navigation
- The header can be reached any place on the web, when scrolling down it will hide, the header except the company name (which give user a sense of what website is it).
- The navigation shows the toc of the websites and the main goal of the website (which is selling the product)

2. Spacing and Whitespace
- For the spacing, it is pretty far apart from each element, giving comfort feeeling to user.
- Overall the whitespaces utilized really good, there is only a few words to read in one eyeside view, which let user concentrate on what it needed to know.

3. Responsiveness
One the mobile, instead of left-right for image-text. It uses text-image vertically. This is how user can easily read the text

# UX

1. Clarity/Goal
- The main goal of the website is to sell this controller, which I think is very straigt forward
  - 1. price on the navigation
  - 2. specs and features, lastly q&a

1. Flow
- Shows user the item in big picture with name first
- starts to tell the features of the product
- more detailed features if user is interested
- q&a section
- footer
- consistantly showing the price and buy cta across the sites

3. Consistency
- the layout is consistency, so user eye doesnt need to keep finding where to see, it's a pleasure experience in this websites
