# Visual design and Aesthetic

**Design style**
**Minimalist** for sure for the first sight.

It's not flat, because it uses 3d object (It's video here also)
- several website uses 3d already, suitable for luxury brands.


**Color scheme**
Black & White - that's starter pack for minimalist design, So far not yet seen a minimalist website with special primary color.

**Typography**

Maison Neue (Paid) - https://www.myfonts.com/collections/maison-neue-font-milieu-grotesque

- looks really good on minimalist website!
