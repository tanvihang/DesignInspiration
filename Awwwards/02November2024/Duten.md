# Visual design and Aesthetic

**Design style**
**Minimalist** for sure for the first sight.

It's not flat, because it uses 3d object (It's video here also)
- several website uses 3d already, suitable for luxury brands.


**Color scheme**
Black & White - that's starter pack for minimalist design, So far not yet seen a minimalist website with special primary color.

**Typography**

Maison Neue (Paid) - https://www.myfonts.com/collections/maison-neue-font-milieu-grotesque

- looks really good on minimalist website!


**Images & graphic**
- Uses really **high quality image & motions**, which makes this website looks very high-end
- Also the graphic, although have no connection, but still fire

# Layout and Structure


**Header and Navigation**
- Typical header navigation, but it's minimal, user need to click to look inside
![alt text](assets/image-10.png)
Theres one thing that makes this header look more luxury is the animation.
- Nav selection text (bottom-up animation)
- Duten word also (bottom-up with alternate character)
- **Search line from left to right animation** 

**Spacing and Whitespace**
It utilize the whitespace really good.
- Every viewing port only have one important sentences to make user concentrate on it
- Also it uses animation for the text so it wont look boring (parallax, bottom-up, enlarging)

For crowded place, like the menu, it uses color to make it up.

**Responsiveness**
It's good.
flex column to flex row.
